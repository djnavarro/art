I'm a computational artist based in Sydney, living on Gadigal land, and making generative art using the R programming language. I post artwork on [twitter](https://twitter.com/djnavarro), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daniellenavarro77/) and [github](https://github.com/djnavarro) and in my other life I am an [academic](https://djnavarro.net/) at the University of New South Wales. This site is written with R, using the [diziet](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-diziet) theme for [hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown).

At the moment I don't sell prints directly: I hope to do so in the future. I do have a [society6 page](https://society6.com/djnavarro), however, so if you'd like to purchase my art as a print, yoga mat, coffee mug, shower curtain or as a variety of other objects, take a look! Unless stated otherwise, the art on this site is released under a Creative Commons [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licence, so you are free to reuse the work as long as you attribute the original to me, and any derivative works are covered by the same licence. A few pieces are released under a [more permissive licence](https://github.com/djnavarro/rtistry).

If you like my art, you can donate to my [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/daniellenavarro77), but my day job already pays the bills, and a better use for the money would be to donate to a suitably worthy organisation. Some causes that matter to me personally include the Sydney [Inner City Legal Centre](https://www.iclc.org.au/), the NSW [Sex Worker Outreach Project](https://swop.org.au/), [Black Rainbow](http://www.blackrainbow.org.au/), and [Lou's Place](https://www.lousplace.com.au/).
