I have a soft spot for the [flametree](https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree) package and series. The algorithm it uses is a simple [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), and was easier to implement than I had been expecting. It was rather popular on twitter. Not only did other people use it, Tyler Morgan-Wall made a very cool 3d version called [raybonsai](https://www.tylermw.com/raybonsai-generate-procedural-3d-trees-in-r/). I've even managed to use it in my own teaching. The most bizarre thing, however, is the fact that I wrote the code in April 2020 and although I'm writing this summary a few months later, it feels like a lifetime ago.
