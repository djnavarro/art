The weird thing about this series is that there is an entire [R package](https://github.com/djnavarro/scopes) for it that I honestly cannot remember writing. According to the commit logs I released the source code sometime in May 2020. Like everything else about this year, the memories of doing this have just vanished into the general maelstrom of "life in 2020".
