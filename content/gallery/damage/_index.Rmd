This series was an experiment to see how close I could get to developing a complete generative art system in a day, while juggling kids, groceries, cleaning, and dentist appointments at the same time. I started the day with a half formed idea and one very poorly structured script I'd written the night before as a proof of concept. The goal was to create a system that has a distinctive look and generates mostly pleasant pieces. Additionally my aims were to [release the source code](https://github.com/djnavarro/damage) as an R package, create [basic documentation](https://damage.dnavarro.net) using pkgdown, generate 100 pieces from the art and [release them under a CC-BY licence](https://github.com/djnavarro/series-damage) and post the series here. 

The results are... okay, I suppose? I didn't have as much time to work on it as I'd have liked to, and the system needs quite a bit of polishing, but it was interesting to see how much I could get done. 


```{r read-manifest, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(bs4cards)

url <- "https://djnavarro.net/series-damage/"

images <- paste0(url, "manifest.csv") %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  filter(
    resolution %in% c(800, 3000), 
    format == "png"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(path = paste0(url, path)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = resolution, 
    names_prefix = "path_", 
    values_from = path
  ) %>% 
  mutate(img_id = as.numeric(img_id)) %>% 
  arrange(img_id)
```

```{r gallery, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
images %>%
  cards(
    image = path_800,
    link = path_3000,
    layout = "image-only", 
    border_radius = 0,
    border_width = 0, 
    width = 2,
    spacing = 3
  )  
```
