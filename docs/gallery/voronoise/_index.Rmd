The [voronoise](https://github.com/djnavarro/voronoise) package came into existence as an attempt to understand ggplot2 internals. It generated the banner image for my [academic website](https://djnavarro.net) and for the [calade blog theme](https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-calade/), has reappeared in later series and even made a guest appearance in my first ever [commissioned artwork](https://github.com/djnavarro/rstudiopostcard). Some of the pieces have a peculiar feel to me because I created them to express emotions about a specific event in my past. I'm never really sure how much of that emotion comes across to other viewers though.
