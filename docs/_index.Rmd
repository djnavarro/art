I'm a computational artist based in Sydney, living on Gadigal land, making generative art using the R programming language, and in my other life I am an [academic `r fontawesome::fa_i("graduation-cap", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://djnavarro.net/). You'll usually find me posting art on [twitter `r fontawesome::fa_i("twitter", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://twitter.com/djnavarro) and [instagram `r fontawesome::fa_i("instagram", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://www.instagram.com/daniellenavarro77/). If you like my art you could support me by:

&nbsp; &nbsp; subscribing to my [patreon `r fontawesome::fa_i("patreon", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://www.patreon.com/djnavarro) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; donating to my [paypal `r fontawesome::fa_i("paypal", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://www.paypal.me/daniellenavarro77) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; buying eco-friendly NFTs on [hic et nunc `r fontawesome::fa_i("palette", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://www.henext.xyz/djnavarro/onsale) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; buying prints and more from [society6 `r fontawesome::fa_i("shopping-cart", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://society6.com/djnavarro) <br>

Unless stated otherwise, the art on this site is released under a CC-BY-SA licence [`r fontawesome::fa_i("creative-commons", verify_fa = FALSE)` `r fontawesome::fa_i("creative-commons-by", verify_fa = FALSE)` `r fontawesome::fa_i("creative-commons-sa", verify_fa = FALSE)`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/): you are free to reuse the work as long as you attribute the original to me, and derivative works must use the same licence. 

I believe that art can serve the public good: I often use the proceeds of art sales to support charities, and sometimes run fundraisers (e.g., [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/data-science-art-to-support-a-womens-refuge)) to support worthy causes. Some organisations that matter to me personally include the Sydney [Inner City Legal Centre](https://www.iclc.org.au/), the NSW [Sex Worker Outreach Project](https://swop.org.au/), [Black Rainbow](http://www.blackrainbow.org.au/), and [Lou's Place](https://www.lousplace.com.au/).
